Connect the ECHO pin of the HC-SR04 to a row on the breadboard (let's call it Row A).
Insert one end of the 20 k立 resistor (R1) into the same Row A. (This means one end of R1 is electrically connected to ECHO.)
Insert the other end of the 20 k立 resistor into another row on the breadboard (referred to as Row B), which serves as the "middle node."
Connect one end of the 10 k立 resistor (R2) to Row B (the same row as the other end of R1).
Connect the other end of the 10 k立 resistor to the blue rail (GND) of the breadboard.
Run a wire from Row B to pin D9 of the MKR1010.
This way, the voltage at Row B will be the divided voltage of approximately 3.3V (when ECHO is 5V), which is suitable for D9
