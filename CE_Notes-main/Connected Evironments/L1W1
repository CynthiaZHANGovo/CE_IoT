Lecture 1 (Introduction to IoT)

IoT is not only about “connecting devices,” but about sensing, transmitting, and interpreting information to make environments more responsive. 
It’s about understanding why we connect things

Workshop 1

we drew birds and sketched different types of sensors and abstract concepts.
No matter whether an idea is random, unrealistic, or impossible, it’s worth exploring, which means unexpected results often come from wild thoughts.
This exercise made me realize that in the early design stage, it’s better not to judge feasibility too early but to let ideas grow first before filtering them lol
