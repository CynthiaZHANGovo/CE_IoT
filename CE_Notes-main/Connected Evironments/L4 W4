It was interesting to notice that many different devices actually use very similar types of sensors, but the way they are combined and applied makes their functions completely different.

It also showed how important context is.
IoT systems have to adapt to where they are placed. 
For example, the IoT device we saw at the intersection worked in a specific way because of its unique location and purpose.
