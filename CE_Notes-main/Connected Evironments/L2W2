Lecture 2 (Sensors, Actuators and Communication) 

We learned about different types of sensors and actuators, and the communication methods that allow IoT devices to send data. 
Sensing, acting, and communicating form the core loop of an IoT system, and the choices made in each step directly affect the systemâ€™s performance.

Workshop 2

Our group designed a banana growth monitoring system. 
I liked how everyone started with unique ideas, and through discussion, we gradually merged them into a coherent concept.
I learned that a prototype is not only a product draft but also a language for communication, because it helps express how something works more effectively than words alone.
